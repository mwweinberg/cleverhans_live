As of August of 2021, I have a v1 of the site!  It is probably not stable in any real sense of the term, but it is superficially functional.   /archive has all of the old attempts.  game1.js is just a place to quickly save working versions and I go and can be ignored in the final build.  

While you can't tell from looking at it, this site is actually the result of years of very slowly learning how to program. At some point in the long-ago past, I decided that the world needed a website that simulated Clever Hans. Step one was to purchase the domain cleverhans.org.  I took that step immediately.  Step two was to actually learn how to make a website.  That took a bit longer. The thing that took me the longest to figure out was how to maintain the values between screens.  While I don't use it here, p5.js (and the Coding Train videos) is the only reason I can pretend to understand how javascript works.  Also, big thanks to the phaser community and Emanuele Feronato for the book on phaser development for making a framework that allowed even me to make this work.

The Hans Commission investigated Clever Hans in 1904 and Clever Hans' trainer Wilhelm von Osten died in 1909.   Therefore I am assuming that all of the images of Clever Hans are from that time period and are currently in the public domain.  

Finally, I am aware that "Nachmal Hans!" may not directly translate into "again Hans!".
